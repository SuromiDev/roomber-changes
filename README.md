Create a free Roomber account and discover a new messaging app that's better than anything else out there. Roomber is a fun way to talk with your friends and stay connected.


# How to update

First, write all your client code in the src/client/ folder, then when you wanna `git push` or test the app, run `node obfuscator.js` in the console, wait a second and there you go! client/Roomber.js should update with the obfuscated code.

Remember, when you make a new JS file in src/client/, remember to put it in the JSON object found in `obfuscate.js`. Add it in the order you want it to load.
And as always, before you `git push`, always test!
